Phase 1:Problem Definition and Design Thinking
Project Submission
Project Title:Data Warehousing with IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse
Problem Statement
Begin by clearly defining the problem you are trying to solve. What is the challenge or opportunity you're addressing? Use this section to provide a succinct description of the problem statement.

Problem Statement:
 Insert the problem statement here.
Understanding the Problem
To effectively address the problem, it's crucial to have a deep understanding of its various facets. This involves researching and gathering information to comprehend the scope, context, and nuances of the problem.

Stakeholder Analysis
Identify the key stakeholders involved in or affected by the problem. This could include customers, users, partners, employees, or regulatory bodies. Understanding their needs and expectations is crucial.

Market Research
Conduct research to understand the market dynamics, trends, and competition relevant to the problem. This can involve analyzing industry reports, competitor strategies, and customer feedback.

User Research
If applicable, gather insights from the end-users by conducting surveys, interviews, or observations. This helps in understanding their pain points and preferences.

Design Thinking Approach
Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that focuses on empathy, ideation, and prototyping. Here's how we will apply design thinking to address the problem:

1. Empathize
Empathy is at the core of design thinking. We will empathize with the stakeholders to deeply understand their perspectives and challenges.
Methods: Interviews, surveys, and user observations.
2. Define
After gathering insights, we will define the problem from a user-centered perspective. This involves synthesizing data to create a problem statement.
Methods: Persona creation, journey mapping, and problem framing.
3. Ideate
We will generate creative ideas to address the defined problem. Brainstorming sessions and ideation workshops will be conducted.
Methods: Brainstorming, mind mapping, and ideation exercises.
4. Prototype
Creating prototypes and mockups to visualize and test our ideas. This step helps in quickly iterating and refining solutions.
Methods: Wireframing, mockups, and low-fidelity prototypes.
Testing the prototypes with users and stakeholders to gather feedback and refine the solutions iteratively.
Methods: Usability testing, feedback surveys, and A/B testing.
Proposed Design
In this section, outline the initial design concepts or solutions you are considering based on the insights gained from the design thinking process.

Proposed Design: Briefly describe the initial design concepts or solutions.

Next Steps
Summarize the immediate next steps to progress with solving the problem.
Assign responsibilities and set a timeline for each step.
Include any additional research, data gathering, or brainstorming that needs to occur.
Next Steps: List the specific actions, responsibilities, and deadlines.

This document provides a framework for understanding and addressing a problem using design thinking. Ensure that you adapt the content and structure to fit the specific problem you are working on. The key is to maintain a user-centric focus throughout the process and iterate as needed to arrive at an effective solution.
